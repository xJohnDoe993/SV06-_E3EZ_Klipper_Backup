I use a Sovol SV06 Plus with BTT E3EZ Board, KlipperScreen(on generic 7 inch Touchscreen) and CRTouch Autolevel Sensor. 
This repo is my personal Backup but may it can help someone to setup their SV06 Plus with BTT E3EZ Board.

I used the great Repo from Bassamanator and the BTT E3EZ Repo for the initial Setup.
